### 🧩 Key Building Blocks: The Magic Under the Hood

- **Data Integrity Enforcer** → JSON Schema validation via Ajv to snag invalid claims right at the door, preventing downstream disasters.  
- **Smart Rate Lookups** → Pull procedure codes and pricing from Aurora-stored fee schedules for lightning-fast, accurate adjudication.  
- **Resilient Queuing** → SQS handles traffic spikes with idempotency checks, shielding DynamoDB from overload.  
- **Fail-Safe Mechanisms** → Dead-letter queues capture stragglers, while CloudWatch alarms trigger SNS alerts for immediate intervention.  
- **Analytics Powerhouse** → Glue crawlers feed Athena workgroups (e.g., qmtry-billing-wg), fueling curated QuickSight datasets.  
- **IaC for Insights** → CDK deploys QuickSight datasets and dashboards seamlessly, integrating your templates and data sources.  
- **AI Narrative Wizard** → Bedrock's Claude 3.5 Sonnet analyzes remits against contracts, crafting variance reports that read like a detective novel—complete with clues and resolutions.
